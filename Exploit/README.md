## Description
This small demo c program demonstrates the dirtypipe exploit by modifying the read cache for the '/etc/passwd' file on a target machine with only read access to
escalate to root.

## Usage
Compile and run this file on the attacking machine to perform the exploit after ssh'ing into the 'readonly' user on the target machine with `ssh readonly@<ipaddress>`.
Once the exploit has been performed simply log in as root using `su root` and the new password 'SecurePassword'.

## Compile
`gcc dirtypipe_passwd.c -crypt -o dirtypipe_passwd`

## Run
`./dirtypipe`
