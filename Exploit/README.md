## Description
This small demo c program demonstrates the dirtypipe exploit by modifying the read cache for the '/etc/passwd' file on a target machine with only read access to
escalate to root.

The program creates a pipe between the user and the cache buffer. The program opens a root-owned file as read-only and uses the pipe to splice new user info into the cached copy of the file.

This file was originally authored by Max Kellermann, with additional edits by Andrew Trexler, and additional cleanup and comments added by Katrina Siegfried. The original exploit demo file can be found [here](https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/).

## Usage
Compile and run this file on the attacking machine to perform the exploit after ssh'ing into the 'readonly' user on the target machine with `ssh readonly@<ipaddress>`.
Once the exploit has been performed simply log in as root using `su root` and the new password 'SecurePassword'.

## Compile
`gcc dirtypipe_passwd.c -crypt -o dirtypipe_passwd`

## Run
`./dirtypipe`

## TODO
- cmake for compiling code
